# CRISP-DM for HW1: Linear Regression

## 1. Business Understanding
Goal: Provide an interactive learning tool to understand linear regression. Users can tweak data generation parameters and see how model parameters and metrics respond.

Success Criteria:
- App runs on web, responsive plots.
- Users can adjust a, b, n, noise; can upload CSV with x,y.
- Reports coefficients and metrics (RMSE, R2) with visuals.

## 2. Data Understanding
Two sources:
- Synthetic data generated by y = a*x + b + e with Gaussian noise.
- Optional user CSV with columns x,y. Basic schema validation applied.

Exploration: We plot scatter and residuals to visually assess linearity and noise.

## 3. Data Preparation
- Synthetic: evenly spaced x in [-10, 10], configurable count n; noise ~ N(0, sigma^2).
- Uploaded data: trimmed to required columns; no missing handling beyond simple validation.

## 4. Modeling
- Model: Ordinary Least Squares via scikit-learn `LinearRegression`.
- Features: single feature x.
- Target: y.

## 5. Evaluation
- Metrics: MSE, RMSE, R2 on the same dataset to keep the focus on parameter influence.
- Visuals: fitted line over scatter; residual plot.

## 6. Deployment
- Local: `streamlit run app.py`.
- Cloud: push to GitHub and deploy on Streamlit Cloud.

## 7. Notes and Limitations
- This app is educational; it does not include train/validation splits.
- Uploaded data must be numeric and include x,y columns.
